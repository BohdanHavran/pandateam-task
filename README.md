# Panda Team Task

In this task, I automatically install Jenkins using Docker compose. In this task, Jenkins and DSL scripts played the role of creating a pipeline for a containerized Python application. Also, with the help of Docker compose, a monitoring system (Grafana + Prometheus) was configured to track the state of the server and the application container, and I used terraform to create the infrastructure for these tasks. If you don't have [Docker installed](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/ubuntu/), you should install it<br> Elements that were used in this task:<br>
